# notebooks
Thie repository contains notebooks with simulations and integrations for LaunchDarkly's experimentation product.

As of now all of the notebooks will work with Polynote. None of the notebooks require Spark nor Python. So you can follow the [installation instructions on the Polynote site](https://polynote.org/latest/docs/installation/), but skip the Spark and Python pieces.

The other thing worth doing is adding the folder that you cloned this repo to to [Polynote's config.yml file](https://polynote.org/latest/docs/server-configuration/).
